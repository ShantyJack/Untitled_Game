This repository contains all the code for an untitled action-adventure game I was making around 2020. The sprites and sounds have been removed, but the code can be viewed by going to the scripts folder and opening the .gml files. feel free to poke around; The players actions are controlled using a custom state machine setup that also has buffered actions, and the AI also uses a modified version of A* pathfinding.
